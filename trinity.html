<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the high quality soccer programme and the help and guidance which is offered. I feel like there is always someone to go to if I am needing help with a subject and the people are very friendly. The bell center facilities are also top quality along with an outstanding soccer field to play on.  </p>

<p>I am majoring in Mathematics because I find it easier than other subjects and I know that a math degree is highly sought after.
